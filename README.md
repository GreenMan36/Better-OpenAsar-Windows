# Better OpenAsar Installer For Windows

This is just an improved install script for OpenAsar. 
Sometimes when Discord updates, OpenAsar doesn't stay installed and you need to re-run the installer.  
But then the intaller you have is for the old version.  
This fixes that and also makes it work for all Discord versions.  

## Demo

### TLDW

1. Show a little animation
2. Pick the Discord version
3. Confirm the info
4. Install
5. Done!

If there's any issues, the installer will give you a nice error message which an be used to quickly debug where things went wrong.

## Misc

- No, Ducko doesn't want to use this script as the main Windows script.
- Please also check out some of my other projects at [GreenMan36.github.io](https://GreenMan36.github.io) or [github.com/GreenMan36](https://github.com/GreenMan36).
